# Summary of learnings

### Socket Programming

Working with UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control
Protocol) involves the utilization of socket programming. Throughout this project, I gained
comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in creating both client and server sockets. I
learned how to establish robust communication channels between them and efficiently handle the
transfer of data using UDP and TCP protocols. This entailed understanding the nuances of socket
programming, including socket creation, binding, listening, accepting connections, and data
transmission.

### Client-Server Architecture

A solid grasp of the fundamentals of client-server architecture was
imperative for the successful completion of this project. By delving into this subject, I
acquired a deep understanding of how to architect and design client and server components to
facilitate seamless communication and effective data exchange. This involved identifying the
specific responsibilities of the client and server, establishing connection protocols, and
implementing robust communication mechanisms. Through this experience, I gained insights into the
challenges and considerations involved in creating a reliable client-server architecture.

### Request-Response Communication

The implementation of functionalities such as GET, PUT, and
DELETE in this project necessitated the use of request-response communication patterns. This
provided me with valuable experience in structuring requests from the client and handling them on
the server side. I learned how to parse and interpret incoming requests, perform the necessary
operations or actions on the server based on the request type, and generate appropriate responses
to be sent back to the client. This entailed managing different HTTP methods, validating and
processing user input, and ensuring that responses accurately reflected the requested actions.

### Protocol Design

Designing a custom communication protocol between the client and server was a
crucial aspect of this project. I recognized the importance of defining a well-structured and
standardized format for requests and responses, including the necessary metadata and payload. By
crafting a protocol specific to the project's requirements, I ensured efficient and reliable
communication between the client and server components. This involved establishing clear rules
and guidelines for data exchange, message formatting, error handling, and any additional
specifications necessary for the project's scope.

### File I/O Operations

In the context of this project, I worked extensively with file
input/output operations in Java. Specifically, I leveraged these operations to store key-value
pairs in a json file on the server side. This required proficiency in reading the contents
of the file, modifying its data as required by the client's requests, and efficiently updating
the file to reflect the changes. Additionally, I ensured proper error handling and validation
during file operations, guaranteeing the integrity and consistency of the stored data.

### Error Handling and Resilience

Throughout the development process, I encountered various
scenarios that necessitated robust error handling and the implementation of resilient strategies.
This included handling situations such as invalid or malformed requests from clients, network
errors that could disrupt communication, and unexpected behaviors exhibited by either the server
or the client. By addressing these challenges, I gained expertise in gracefully handling errors,
providing informative error messages, and incorporating fault tolerance measures to ensure the
stability and reliability of the application.

### Testing and Debugging

Similar to any software development project, testing and debugging
played critical roles in ensuring the quality and functionality of the application. I acquired
proficiency in writing comprehensive unit tests to validate individual components and functions,
as well as performing integration testing to assess the seamless interaction between different
modules of the system. By utilizing various testing frameworks and tools, I could identify and
address any issues or bugs that arose during the development phase. This allowed me to enhance
the overall performance and reliability of the application.

### Documentation and Code Organization

Recognizing the significance of well-documented code and
an organized project structure, I prioritized maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation
throughout the development process. This included documenting the purpose and functionality of
classes, methods, and arranging the codebase in a way that allows code re-usability across the
project.
